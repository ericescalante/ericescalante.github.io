title: Welcome!

Welcome to my first (and hopefully last) blog! I hope to make this a space were people can find something interesting and/or amusing as I share my adventures in the wild, wild world of software development. It started as a place to host a post I've been working on for the last couple of weeks about reactjs after a friend suggested me to give it a go. Once that post is live, I hope to add more entries as new challenges come along and present opportunities to learn more cool stuff to share :)

To know more about me (not that there's any perceivable benefit or pleasure to be derived therefrom), check out the [about](/about) page.
